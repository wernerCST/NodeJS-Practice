MongoDb -> is a NoSQL, each db can have one or more collections(table), and each    
           collection can have one or more documents(rows)

MongoDb is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want
with the querying and indexing that you need.

Key Features---
Document based: MongoDB stores data in documents (field-value pair data structures, NoSQL);
Scalable: Vary easy to distribute data across multiple machines as your users and amount of data grow;
Flexibility: No document data schema required, so each document can have different number and type of fields;
Performance: Embedded data models, indexing, sharding, flexible documents, native duplication, etc;

BSON: Data format MongoDB uses for data storage. Like JSON, but typed. So MongoDB documents are typed.

Embedding/Denormalizing: including related data into a single document. This allows for quicker access
                         and easier data models (it's not always the best solution though);

-- side notes
A cluster on Atlas MongoDB is like an instance of our DB 

Mongoose is an object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, a higher 
level of abstraction.

Mongoose allows for a rapid and simple development of MongoDB database interaction.

Features: scemas to model data and relationships, easy data validation, simple query API,
          Middleware, etc.

Mongoose model: a wrapper for the schema, providing an interface to the database 
                for crud operations.
